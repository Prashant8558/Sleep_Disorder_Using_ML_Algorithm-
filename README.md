# Sleep Disorder Using ML Algorithm :-

# Introduction :-

Sleep disorders affect millions of individuals worldwide, significantly impacting their health, productivity, and quality of life. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. This proposal outlines a project to develop a machine learning (ML) model to detect sleep disorders based on physiological data and patient history.

# Objectives:-

Develop a machine learning model to accurately detect various sleep disorders.

Utilize physiological data (e.g., heart rate, brain activity, oxygen levels) and patient history (e.g., sleep patterns, demographic data).

Create a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers to input data and receive diagnostic insights.

# Methodology :-

# Data Preprocessing :-

Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers.

Normalization: Standardize physiological signals.

Segmentation: Break down continuous signals into meaningful epochs.

# Feature Engineering :-

Extract relevant features from physiological signals (e.g., frequency domain features from EEG).
Use domain knowledge to derive features from patient history.

# Model Selection :-

Supervised Learning: Use labeled data to train the model.

Algorithms: Consider Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

# Implementation :-

# Software and Tools :-

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy

Platforms: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

# System Architecture :-

Data Input: Interfaces for uploading patient data.

Processing Layer: Preprocess data and extract features.

Model Layer: Apply the trained ML model to detect sleep disorders.

Output Layer: Provide diagnostic results and visualizations.

# Conclusion :-

From the exploratory data analysis, I have concluded that the sleep orders depends upon three main factors that are gender, occupation and BMI of the patient.
The males have more instance of Insomia whereas femlaes have more instances of Sleep Apnea. In addition the that people with occupation such as nurses are more prone to sleep disorders. 
The BMI of the patient also plays a vital role in the prediction of sleep disorders. The patients who are either Obese or overweight are more prone to sleep disorders.
Coming to the classfication models, both the models performed pretty good, however the Random Forest Classifier have excellent results with 89% accuracy.
